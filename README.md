# Cloud-Linux-Project
System Admininstration Project for SP2025

The primary objective of this collaboritive (optional) project is to design, implement, and
evaluate a performance monitoring solution for a remote, cloud-based Linux
infrastructure based on number real-world stresses that affect production servers.

To-do:
- Change OS of client to windows server so that webrowser can be accessed at "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
- Add updated code to all machines
- Create unique user and/or groups in client
- Double check firewall to ensure security is safe (make sure communication for servers is allowed, but nothing else)
- Implement Cron jobs for starting server codes, client code, and monitoring of failure to allow automatic restart
- Create pipe and log directories (refer to server code comments)
- Testing
- Record video demonstration of it running

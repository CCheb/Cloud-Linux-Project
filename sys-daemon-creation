Step 1:
	Create the script that the system process will run (you can have it anywhere just remember where it is)
Step 2:
	Create inital service file. Make sure you follow the correct format so that systemd will read it properly.
	Place the file in /etc/systemd/system/#nameofservice#
Step 3: 
	Reload systemd so that it can see the newly created service file: sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Step 4: 
	Enable the new servie so that it runs automatically on boot: sudo systemctl enable #nameofservice#
Step 5:
	Start the service using: sudo systemctl start #nameoffservice#

You can disable the service with the disable command

You can stop the service with the stop command

In the case you change the location of the file make sure to do a daemon-reload and a restart command

You can view any logs created by the service using sudo journalctl -u #nameofservice#



I have the script located in my home directory as /home/amsebastian12/sequential-stressor.sh

The service itself is in /etc/systemd/system/sequential_stressors.service
